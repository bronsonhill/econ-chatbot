a)  The initial market equilibrium is at point A, where market demand intersects industry supply. We know that the current LR equilibrium price is pA = \$27. Because there are 40 firms in the industry, and each firm produces output qa = 60 units, the market (industry) output is QA = 40*60 = 2400.

Each firm produces at the minimum of its average cost curve (AC), which is achieved at the output qa= 60. This is represented by point a on the graph for the firm (on the right).

After tax is reduced by \$2, the average cost (AC) and the marginal cost (MC) curves of each firm shift down by the amount of tax decrease, Î”t = \$2 (because this is a per-unit tax, the reduction in AC and MC is equal to the reduction in tax, \$2).

The number of firms in the industry stays the same in SR because firms are not able to enter or exit the industry in SR. Therefore, the industry supply, which is the horizontal sum of the supplies of all firms, shifts down by \$2 as well. We can also think of it as a shift of SR industry supply to the right.

What would happen in SR equilibrium? The demand function stays the same, but the supply function shifts down (or to the right); therefore, the new intersection point B, the new SR equilibrium will correspond to lower price pB and the higher output QB. 

Because the demand function is downward sloping, and the downward-sloping supply function shifts down by \$2, the price will decrease by less than \$2.

SR equilibrium (summary): price is pB (decreases from the initial price of \$27 by less than \$2), market output is QB, higher than the initial quantity of 2400. The market SR equilibrium is at point B. The number of firms stays the same.

At the new SR equilibrium price, pB, each firm produces output qB. At this output, the MC of the firm is equal to the price, which guarantees that the firm maximises its profit. The output qB is greater than qa = 60, because MC and AC shifts down by \$2, but the price decreases by less than \$2. The output qB is not at the minimum of the AC for tax = \$1, it is to the right. Therefore, at this output, MC (which is equal to price pB) is above the AC, and the firm will make a positive profit (represented by the green rectangle).

Each firm in SR equilibrium (summary): output is qB > qa = 60; profit is positive.'

b) What would happen in the long run? Because each firm makes a positive profit in SR, this could not be a LR equilibrium.

Attracted by positive profits, new firms start entering the industry. As a result, SR industry supply shifts even further to the right (because more firms can produce more output for any given price). As more firms keep entering, the industry supply shifts further and further.

As demand does not change, but supply increases (shifts to the right), the market price decreases. How long will this process of firms entering and price decreasing continue? The firms will enter as long as profits are positive. Because more firms result in a lower market price for their output, the profits in the industry decrease as the number of firms increases.
Firms will enter until price reaches pc = \$25, where firms make zero profit, i.e., the new min of the ACLR curve.

In the LR, the price will decrease by exactly the amount of tax reduction, \$2.

New LR equilibrium: price pc = \$25, output QC (LR equilibrium is at point C); more firms in the industry; each firm produces output qa= 60 and makes zero profit.

Compared to the initial LR equilibrium: price down to \$25 (it decreases by the same amount as the tax decrease, \$2), market output Q is up, quantity produced by each firm is the same: qa = 60, profits are the same (equal to zero), the number of firms N increased.

Compared to the SR equilibrium: price is down, market output is up, quantity produced by each firm is down, profits are down to 0, the number of firms in the industry, N, increased.
